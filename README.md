Autonomous Repository V5RC. All code was created by members of team 88875M, Blue Bomber. This code is strictly for use by our team unless we decide to release it in the future. This github serves as documentation for our programming progress and autons. While there will be some pictures and details of the code in the notebook, we link our github page in section one of our journal. For versions of our code please see the releases section of this repository. For different parts of the code (odom, pid, drive code) please refer to branches and select the desired one. Our full code will be pasted in main.
